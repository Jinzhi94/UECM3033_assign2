## Task 1 --  $LU$ Factorization or SOR method

The reports, codes and supporting documents are to be uploaded to Github at: 

[https://github.com/Jinzhi94/UECM3033_assign2](https://github.com/Jinzhi94/UECM3033_assign2)

Explain your selection criteria here.

To decide which whether LU or SOR method should be use to solve the linear system Ax = b,
we will first check whether the matrix A is positive definite matrix or not. To check this,
we will use Convergence theorem of SOR method, which states that, SOR method will converge if
and only if A is positive definite. Furthermore, by theorem, to check whether a matrix is
positive definite is equivalent to check whether it can apply cholesky factorization.
So if A cant apply cholesky factorization then we use LU method to solve the system.

Explain how you implement your `task1.py` here.

For the LU method, I decompose the matrix A into upper and lower triangular matrix, then solve
them simultaneously to the the solution.
For the SOR method, I set the iteration limit to be 10 so that the solution we get is close enough 
to the actual solution, then i break down the A into two part which are D(diagonal matrix and
L(lower triangular matrix with 0 diagonal).
Before using the formula of SOR method, we will try to seek for the optimal omega value so that the
convergence rate is at maximum, so i implemented the function omegaSearch which will helps us to 
find the greatest eigenvalue of K=D^-1(D-A), then apply the formula omega = 2*(1-np.sqrt(1-p**2))/p**2.
Next we will compute the Q, K and c respectively and finally optained the recursive formula for the system
X = KX + c, iterate it within the iteratio limit we will get the result.

Lastly, i have corrected all the solution we get into 4 decimal places.

The answer for the first system is [ 1.  1.  1.] and it is solved by LU method.
The answer for the second system is [ 1.  -1.   4.  -3.5  7.  -1. ], it is solved by LU method also.

## Task 2 -- SVD method and image compression

Put here your picture file (img.jpg)

![img.jpg](img.jpg)

How many non zero element in $\Sigma$?
There are 800 nonzero element in sigma for each color

Put here your lower and better resolution pictures. Explain how you generate
these pictures from `task2.py`.
![ImageLow.jpg](ImageLow.jpg)
![ImageBetter.jpg](ImageBetter.jpg)

To compress the original image into lower resolution, I had applied SVD on the image. To do this,
first, I extract the three basic color red, green, and blue out of the image into an array, then 
I defined a function called decomposition to perform the SVD and obtained the U, sigma, V matrix
for each color(red, green, blue). Next, I kept the first n nonzero element in sigma of each color,
in this task, n is 30 and 200. After I got my new 'Sigma' for each color, I combined the U, new sigma,
and V together again to obtain the image with new resolution(lower resolution). Finally, the image is 
generated by the command np.dstack((r,g,b)).

What is a sparse matrix?
By definition, in numerical analysis, sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero.
